In React Router Dom v6, navigating to a route with a dynamic segment that is not defined in the `useParams` hook will cause unexpected behavior.  For example, if you have a route like `/users/:userId` and try to navigate to `/users/`, you might not see an error, but the component associated with the `/users/:userId` route will render with `userId` as undefined, leading to potential runtime errors if your component doesn't handle this case gracefully. This is different from v5, where such navigation might result in a 404 error.
